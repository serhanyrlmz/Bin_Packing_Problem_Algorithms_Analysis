## Different approaches to bin packing problem and analysis of algorithms

* In this project, we have examined the bin packing optimization problem and related algorithms from many aspects such are correctness, worst-case time complexity, and space complexity. Also, those algorithms implemented on samples and reported in test cases. Performance and correctness of experimental analysis is discussed. Next fit algorithm as a brute force algorithm and best fit heuristic algorithm as a heuristic algorithm were main focuses. I have collaborated with one more CS student throughout the project.
* Please refer to the final report for details and better understanding.
