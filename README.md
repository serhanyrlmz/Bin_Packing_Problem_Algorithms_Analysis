## Different approaches to bin packing problem and analysis of algorithms

* In this project, we have examined the bin packing optimization problem and related algorithms from many aspects such are correctness, worst-case time complexity, and space complexity. Also, those algorithms were implemented on samples and reported in test cases. The performance and correctness of experimental analysis are discussed. Next fit algorithm as a brute force algorithm and best fit heuristic algorithm as a heuristic algorithm were the main focuses. I have collaborated with one more CS student throughout the project.
* Please refer to the final report for details and better understanding.
